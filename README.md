# This project is built to solidify knowledge on OOP realm and practice implementing datastructures

## In this project, I have learnt:
- How to implement a real-life case of Stack, Graph and HashMap data structures
- Object Oriented Programming: define a complex yet manageable classes with state
- Object Oriented Programming: break down long, complex method to divided modules for managements (Composition principal)
- Implement functions that work with state through observer pattern and recursion
- Optimize the look up (query) time of new feed functionality (compares to native list datastructure)
- Type safety and simple testing using Bash scripting automation
